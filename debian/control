Package: ptmd
Architecture: any
Depends: libcgraph6, lldpd, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Prescriptive Topology Manager Daemon
 This daemon verifies that the node it runs on is connected correctly
 to its neighbors. Using a network graph specification in Graphviz's
 DOT language, this ptmd determines the expected connectivity of the
 node it is running on, verifies the expected connectivity with the
 actual connectivity using lldpd and notifies the relevant clients of
 the pass/fail status of the connectivity check for each port.
 The daemon also supports Bi-directional forwarding detection for
 singlehop and multihop sessions. BFD sessions can be started via
 topology file and client API.

Package: libptm-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Prespective Topology Manager library - development files
 This package contains APIs needed by clients to interfaces with ptmd.
